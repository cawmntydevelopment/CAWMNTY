                  class="mb-3 p-6 font-light text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-break manifestoBorder">A Manifesto on a Decentralized Social Clearing House ...(AKA) CAW <br><br>The concept of decentralization has been lost to some of us over time, <br>those who forgot why Bitcoin was created, the issues blockchain and cryptocurrency is meant to solve. <br>To be decentralized means there is no single person, entity, nor group which has ultimate control nor<br>benefit over a system/<br><br>In a decentralized system, there is not one man who via desire or persuasion could cripple the system in any meaningful way<br>This means from both a technical standpoint (i.e, a developer who can stop trading, or disable the protocol through the use of smart contracts) <br>and a financial one (e.g, an entity who has n+1 (infinite) tokens, and could dump them if they so wished, but decides not to.) <br><br>That is not to say that a proper decentralized system is without whales nor its own cornerstones. <br>There are always those that may have a greater affect upon a network, or 'matter' through entropy or their own hard work. <br><br>CAW began as nothing, there was no developer, no information, no medium of communication. Simply. a contract.<br><br>Freedom given to the people to discover CAW's meaning amongst themselves. This has gone well, <br>and so we would like to present our specification for the second phase of CAW. But before we do, <br>some things must be said and taken note of: <br><br>     1. This is a only a specification. It is up to the cawmmunity to write and deploy the protocol. <br>     2. It is strongly recommended that a peer group is formed to develop and review smart contracts. <br> as there is no leader in this process, all types will attempt to claim ownership of the process. <br> there will those everso helpful who claim to be able to 'do it all' but will write the perfect code<br> with the perfect backdoor   Only a cawmmunity reviewed and accepted contract on a public github will be acceptable<br>     3. After deployment, the deployer must renounce any keys they have to the contracts. There will be no multi-sig,  no upgradeable proxyies.<br> It will not matter who deployed because they will be equal with all with no specfic benefit nor advantage. Just get the contract right.<br><br>We propose: <br><br>a. A protocol made up of many on-chain smart contracts for sending messages  publically or p2p with a max character limit of 420. <br>b. A specification for the frontends, of which many will be made, to interact with this protocol. <br>The general function of the protocol and its contracts is as follows: <br><br> i. Burn CAW through a contract to mint an NFT. This burned caw will go to 0x0. The NFT will be your username. <br>  a. The fewer characters in your username, the higher the cost. <br>  b. Every username is unique, and may use a-z and 0-9, without the use of special characters (emojis, etc..,) or capital letters. <br><br> ii. All user activity, social and financial flows through their NFT username. Whoever owns this NFT has access to that account. <br> This includes, but is not limited to, their CAW balance and access to that user's direct messages (DMs). <br><br> iii. Ownership and management of the NFTs will be completely on-chain. For instance, the registration of the username 'cawdev'<br>  will be stored directly on-chain, along with all of the data associated. <br><br> iv. Holding the NFT (note holding, not staking), allows the user to deposit or withdraw CAW into a contract wallet. <br> The ownership of the NFT will serve as the key to this wallet. For users using multiple NFTs they may specify which by a unique number associated. <br><br> v. A user may spend CAW in the following way on the protocol. <br><br>  i. Making a CAW (Akin to tweeting). <br>   a. This cost will be taken in CAW, and then distributed proportionally to all other stakers. <br>  <br>  ii. Liking someone else's CAW. <br>   a. This is closer to tipping. The CAW will be taken and directly sent to the OP (orginal poster's) wallet. <br>  <br>  iii. ReCAWing (akin to a retweet). <br>   a. The cost of which will be taken in CAW and sent to OP's wallet. <br><br>  vi. For receiving the CAW we envision a mostly gasless contract, in which signatures may push CAW balance between users and the application in a contract.<br>   The only thing a user should be spending gas on is: <br>   a. The minting of an NFT. <br>   b. Depositing or withdrawing CAW. <br><br>  vii. DM's should be 'free' and executed via a trustless handshake between two accounts to enable secure peer-to-peer messaging. <br>   Group chats would bring on unneeded complexity, and are not recommended at this point.<br> <br>  viii. All data will be stored permanently. Due to limitations of the Ethereum network, Arweave or similar blockchains may be preferred. The CAW liquidty<br>  may migrate at somepoint to the QOMQQL1,  but that will be addressed once the technical merits reveal itself and the move is obvious.<br><br>  Data storage must be completely trustless, and permanent. The importance of being both censorship resistant and self-policing for the betterment <br>  of a protocol cannot be overstated. CAW is meant only to give you the raw tool kit to build your own online society. <br>  Because of this, there is a distinct gap between the protocol itself, and the frontends. <br><br>At the base level, CAW's contracts for trustless data storage and communication, anything can be posted. We are not naive, and we understand what may be posted. <br>As a result of this, it is up to the frontends to limit content that might obfuscate the reason for CAW's creation. <br><br>That being said, at the level of a protocol no username or message will be blocked or quarantined. <br>Due to the nature of renounced ownership of smart contracts, there will be nobody who can limit such content. <br>(perhaps now you see why renouceing the contract with no multi-sig or upgrades is important.)<br><br>Now onto the frontends. Anybody is free to make or host their own frontend which will show whatever they woud like (or don't). <br>we expect there will be many along with a goal of a mobile app and browser extension that serves as cawing/wallet and instant messager platform that executes<br>the sigs fast and invisible to give a smoother messaging experience (signing a metamask everytime can be tiresome) <br><br>We would recommend that the community makes an alpha frontend, that is more or less 'neutral'. <br>It may filter overt hate/violence, along with hard-illegal activity, remember we need to win the world first. <br>Others may have a better idea of what should be shown, and their perogative should be to create and host their own frontend. <br>The point being, CAW is like Twitter. Except it is bound by no laws, and no central content moderation. <br>However, the frontends may choose to moderate the content however they like, or must to fit whatever legal guidelines they need to fit. <br><br><br>So even if one frontend blocks you, you cannot be policed, and are still free to use the protocol itself. <br><br>Appendix. <br><br>a. It is fairly obvious individuals will begin buying and selling the NFT usernames. <br>It would be wise of a community member to create a trustless and feeless marketplace for such trades, similar to Crypto Punk feeless trades<br>That being said we are pretty aware that as CAW grows to scale,  many will still use FEE marketplaces such as opensea and looks. <br>This means that the deployer of the contract that mints NFTS will have the technical ability to set themselves fee's from opensea. <br><br>We do not think this is a good thing, and ask the cammunity to self police/renounce in order to<br>make sure that trading fees are not set and sent to a private wallet. <br>If it helps, this will imply liabilty for the content posted if your wallet is recieving trading fees<br><br>b. Economically, these are the numbers open for debate and structured so that we understand the practical dollar amount of CAW. <br><br>i. 50 mln market cap (near or current MC). <br>ii. 1 bln market cap (typical memecoin mooning for a bit MC). <br>iii. 10 bln market cap (SHIB-like). <br><br>We will need to be aware of the realities of what happens as the burn of CAW scales, <br>as we will not be able to change the cost of the protocol once set in motion. <br><br>The necessary cost calculations in CAW are: <br><br>i. Amount of CAW to send CAW (all of which is distributed among stakers). <br>ii. Amount of CAW to like a CAW. (sent to OP). <br>iii. Amount of CAW to reCAW a CAW (distributed amount OP and stakers). <br>iv. Burn amounts for various length'd username NFTs.<br><br>We did quite a bit of math to consider the following numbers, but we may have missed something.<br>It was calculated in such a way that liking, reCAWing, and posting, is always affordable at a market cap of 10 billion, <br>while ensuring that the more rare and shorter usernames remain damn expensive. <br><br>The following is the recommended cost, along with the estimated amount in US Dollars in brackets at the three target MC's (50 mln, 1 bln, 10 bln). <br><br>- Single Character username (rare!) BURN 1,000,000,000,000 ($89,985, $1,799,712, $17,997,120) <br>- 2 Character username - BURN 240,000,000,000 CAW ($21,600, $432,000, $4,320,000) <br>- 3 Character Username - BURN 60,000,000,000 CAW ($5400, $108,000, $1,080,000) <br>- 4 Character Username - BURN 6,000,000,000 CAW ($540, $10,800 $108,000) <br>- 5 Character username - BURN 200,000,000 CAW ($18, $360, $3600) <br>- 6 Character username - BURN 20,000,000 CAW ($1.80, $36, $360) <br>- 7 Character username -BURN 10,000,000 CAW (90c, $18, $180) <br>- 8 Character and up username - BURN 1,000,000 CAW (9c, $1.80, $18) <br><br>- Follow an Account (paid 80/20 to account and stakepool) 30000 (na,0.009,9c) <br>- Send a CAW (max xxx Characters) (paid 100 to stakepool) 5000 (na, na, 1.5c) <br>- Like a CAW (paid 80/20 to account and stakepool) 2000 (na,na, $0.007) <br>- ReCAW (paid 50/50 to account and stakepool) 4000 (na,na,1.2c) <br><br>c. Image hosting, and managemement. <br><br>i. The protocol will have no involvement in the hosting of images. This will be up to the frontends to filter,display,host. <br>ii. It is recommended that frontends render URLs from external sources placed inside posts, <br>or employ their own URL shortener so URLs do not destroy the character limit on CAW. <br><br>For example if my CAW was ... "Just had some great fried fish on Point Road with @tk420 #yum #foodie #bestfrens https://savoryandsweetfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/20131020-164849.jpg" <br><br>A frontend should shorten the URL to something like 'https://c.aw/cawdev' prior to the users post, and automically render the URL as a snippet. <br><br>Love, one who still dreams. <br><br>P.S. There are no official socials, nor partner projects or further releases. <br>CAW is by design without design, and it is up the CAWMmunity to shape CAW. <br>Only by giving you the vision and seeing what cames next may we have a truly free and decentralized system.<br></pre>
